# Shop-24x7
## TCS Final Project

### Task
Shop 24x7 is a brick and mortar store which runs 24x7 and wants to create an online
presence and allows users to order online. They have consulted with a Design
agency which has helped in creating UX designs for them and their technical staff
has created API specs based on those Design and Project requirements. You (and
your colleagues) have joined the development team at Shop 24x7.

**As a Team**, The team is responsible for breaking the requirements into smaller
features and assigning them to individual contributors (Fullstack Developers).

**As a Fullstack Engineer**, The developer will be responsible for creating the UX using
Angular and API using NodeJS for the feature assigned. They may have to handle 2
different user personas (Customer and Admin) depending on the feature. The
developer will be responsible for creating Unit test cases using karma or Cypress.

**As a Quality Assurance Engineer**, QA engineers are from a different team and they
have already created a testing suite to test feature implementation and have asked
Fullstack Engineers to provide predefined data-testid on certain HTML elements to
help them test the feature.
